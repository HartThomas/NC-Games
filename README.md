# NC-Games by Thomas Hart

An API for the back end of a Northcoders board game site, where users can post reviews and comments and vote on them.

It uses a PSQL database and is built with Express and hosted on Cyclic using ElephantSQL.

## installation

```
$ npm install pg, express
```

## setup

You will need to create two .env files, one for development and one for test. <br />
In these files write 'PGDATABASE=<database-name>' just add '-test' on the end of the test file.
